        <h1>Understanding Bank of America 529 Plan Fees</h1>
        <strong>Flexible investment choices:</strong> Merrill offers a range of portfolios based on your risk tolerance
        and timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic contributions:</strong> You can automate contributions from your Bank of America account.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Potential rewards:</strong> Preferred Rewards clients may receive <em>discounts or waivers on
                investment fees</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding the Fees: What You Might Pay</h2>
        <p>529 plan fees vary based on the state, the plan provider, and your investment choices. Merrill offers access
            to state-sponsored plans, such as the <strong>NextGen 529 (offered by Maine)</strong>. Here are the key
            types of fees:</p>

        <h3>1. Account Maintenance Fees</h3>
        <p>These are usually <strong>$10–$25 annually</strong> but often waived if you use e-statements or maintain a
            certain balance.</p>

        <h3>2. Investment Management Fees (Expense Ratios)</h3>
        <p>These range from <strong>0.10% to 0.85%</strong> annually and depend on fund type and whether the plan is
            direct-sold or advisor-sold. Direct plans through Merrill tend to be cheaper.</p>

        <h3>3. Sales Charges (Loads)</h3>
        <p>Some funds charge commission fees, but <strong>most 529 plans through Merrill are no-load</strong>,
            especially with direct access.</p>

        <h3>4. Program Management Fees</h3>
        <p>Charged by the state, typically <strong>0.05%–0.20%</strong> annually. This fee is part of the overall
            expense ratio.</p>

        <h3>5. Underlying Fund Fees</h3>
        <p>Mutual funds in your portfolio carry operating expenses included in the total expense ratio. Opting for index
            funds can help reduce these costs.</p>

        <h2>How to Minimize 529 Fees with Bank of America</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <strong>direct-sold plans</strong> via Merrill to avoid broker commissions.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>low-cost index or age-based portfolios</strong>.</li>
            <li>Enroll in <strong>electronic delivery</strong> to waive maintenance fees.</li>
            <li>Check your <strong>Preferred Rewards status</strong> for possible discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and rebalance</strong> your investments regularly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Are the Fees Worth It?</h2>
        <p>Yes—<strong>529 plans still offer excellent long-term value</strong> for education savings despite the fees.
            The tax benefits and potential rewards, especially for Bank of America customers, often outweigh the costs.
        </p>
        <p>Still, it's smart to <strong>compare with your state's plan</strong>, especially if it offers tax deductions
            for contributions.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>While no investment is truly fee-free, Bank of America's 529 plan via Merrill offers a strong combination of
            value, flexibility, and accessibility. By making informed choices, you can keep costs low and give your
            child a solid financial foundation for their education.</p>
